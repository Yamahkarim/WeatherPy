##Objective 
<b>Does the weather truley become warmer as you get closer to the equator?</b>

Though the answer to this question may seem obvious, initally, Data Anlaysis can provide proof of this phenomenon.  

The open weather map public API was used to calculate weather data from a radnomly generated list of 1500 unique cities for the data. 

Images of the data visualizations are provided in the "output_data" directory.
